## Shreya Watane

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast actively working on my pentesting skills, with a focus on identifying vulnerabilities. My technical toolkit includes a solid understanding of **networking**, **Cloud Computing**, **Hardware**, **troubleshooting** and **Python**, alongside a curiosity-driven approach to solving complex problems and learn how systems work at their core.

In general, I'm a naturally curious person who likes to understand how things work and I am always eager to learn new things.

### Short (Not-So-Formal Me🧋)

Outside of tech, I have a passion for driving cars and motorbikes. Always up for a good adventure and listening to podcasts during downtime. Love for Psychology!

You'll often find me scrolling through Twitter🐦
