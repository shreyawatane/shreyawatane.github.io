# My Journey into HTB Dante Pro Lab

I was a beginner trying to push my offensive security skills beyond random CTF boxes and YouTube tutorials. I knew the basics, but this was my first real taste of an "enterprise-style" lab, and it showed me very quickly where I was strong and where I was painfully weak.

If you're also starting out and thinking about Dante, this post is for you. Think of it less as a flex and more as a field guide from someone just a few steps ahead.

## How Dante Feels as a Beginner

Dante throws you into a small simulated corporate network with multiple machines, servers, and an Active Directory environment. You're not just solving one box at a time, you're moving through a network, figuring out how everything connects, and trying not to break your own tunnels every 5 minutes.

As a beginner, here's how it felt:

- **At first**: confusing, noisy, and overwhelming
- **In the middle**: frustrating but strangely addictive
- **By the end**: everything started to "click" and I could actually see my progress


If you're worried that you're "not ready," that's normal. The lab will force you to slow down, take notes, and think like a real pentester instead of just copy-pasting exploits.

## Skills You'll Actually Use (Not Just Buzzwords)

Before Dante, I knew these terms in theory. In the lab, I had to actually *live* them:

### Enumeration
Running nmap, poking at web apps, listing shares, checking services, and writing everything down. The times I rushed this step, I got stuck hard.

### Privilege Escalation
On both Linux and Windows, using tools like LinEnum or winPEAS to spot misconfigurations, SUID binaries, odd services, scheduled tasks, and token abuse opportunities.

### Lateral Movement
Using one compromised machine to get to another—passing credentials around, testing them on SMB, RDP, SSH, and so on.

### Web Attacks
Using my web background (XSS/SQLi/Burp) to get that initial foothold on some machines.

You don't need to be an expert in all of these before you start, but you should at least be comfortable with Linux basics, nmap, and a proxy like Burp. The rest you can learn as you go—because the lab will force you to.

## Pivoting: The Part That Hurts (But Teaches the Most)

If Dante had a main character, it would be **pivoting**.

As a beginner, this was the part that almost broke me. You compromise one machine, only to realize the real target is hidden behind it on an internal network.

So you have to:

- Set up tunnels (SSH, Chisel, Ligolo-ng, etc.)
- Route your traffic through compromised hosts
- Keep track of which ports are forwarded where

At one point, I had multiple pivots chained together and no idea which tunnel was doing what.

That's when I learned a few survival rules:

- Always draw a simple network diagram (even a rough sketch)
- Name your tunnels clearly and comment your commands
- Write down working commands as you go, don't trust your memory

You don't need to be a tunneling ninja on day one, but be ready to practice. Pivoting is where Dante really feels like a "mini internal engagement" and not just another CTF.

## Tools That Helped Me Survive

Here's what actually helped me as a beginner:

### ssh -L / ssh -D
Basic port forwarding and SOCKS proxies. Boring but reliable. If you understand these well, every other pivoting tool makes more sense.

### Chisel / Ligolo-ng
Great for building reverse tunnels and SOCKS proxies when you can't or don't want to rely only on SSH. Once you get a foothold, these tools can open up whole subnets to you.

### NetExec (CrackMapExec successor)
Super useful for:
- Testing credentials across many hosts
- Enumerating SMB shares
- Checking for password reuse

### winPEAS / LinEnum
Your default "what's wrong with this box?" scripts. Don't just run them and scroll—stop when you see something interesting and research it.

### pspy
For watching what's running in the background on Linux. Cron jobs and scheduled scripts basically became my roadmap for escalation on some machines.

Also, have a small library of **reverse shell payloads** ready (from sites like [revshells.com](https://revshells.com) or popular GitHub repos). Generating a new one every time wastes a lot of focus.

## Little Problems That Taught Me Big Lessons

Because I'm a beginner, I hit issues that more experienced people probably blow past, but those problems were actually great teachers:

### Rebuilding tunnels every time I reconnected to the lab
This pushed me to script the boring parts (login + tunnel setup), so I could get back to hacking faster instead of redoing the same manual steps.

### SSH configuration errors and weird client behavior
Instead of giving up, I ended up learning more about SSH configs and wrote a small script to keep things clean and predictable.

### Forgetting where credentials came from
This one hurt. I learned to keep a simple loot file:
- Machine → user → password → where I used it / where it failed

These aren't glamorous, but they're the kind of "real" problems you face on actual assessments.

## If You're a Beginner Thinking About Dante

Here's what I'd tell you, as someone who went in as a learner, not an expert:

- You **don't** need to know everything before you start
- You **do** need patience, curiosity, and a willingness to read, test, and fail
- Take notes like you're going to explain your path to someone else tomorrow
- Don't be afraid to step away, read about a concept, then come back

Dante won't magically turn you into a red teamer overnight. But if you treat it like a structured playground—where every stuck moment is a chance to learn something specific—you'll come out much stronger and much more confident.

You'll get lost in pivots. You'll misread tool output. You'll swear at routes and tunnels.

And then, one day, you'll look at your notes, your diagrams, and the boxes you've rooted and think:

*"Okay… I actually know what I'm doing now."*

That feeling alone makes the journey worth it.
